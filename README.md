Libaries used in various Models:

1. pandas
Pandas is an open-source data manipulation and analysis library for Python, providing powerful data structures like Series and DataFrame. It facilitates data cleaning, transformation, and analysis with an extensive set of functions for handling real-world data efficiently.

2. Numpy
NumPy is an open-source library for Python that supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.
NumPy enables high-performance operations on large datasets and serves as the foundation for other scientific libraries like pandas and SciPy.

3. Matplotlib 
Is an open-source plotting library for Python that enables the creation of static, interactive, and animated visualizations in various formats. It provides a wide range of plotting functions to generate high-quality graphs and charts, such as line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, and histograms. 

4. Seaborn 
It is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It simplifies the creation of complex visualizations with minimal code, offering a variety of plots such as heatmaps, violin plots, and pair plots. Seaborn enhances matplotlib's capabilities with features like automatic estimation and plotting of linear regression models, making it a powerful tool for exploratory data analysis and presentation of statistical result

5.Scikit-learn (sklearn) 
Is a Python library for machine learning built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, including supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. Scikit-learn is designed to interoperate with other Python libraries and tools, making it easy to integrate into data science workflows for tasks like classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.
